'The H-2A visa program was established to address labor shortages in U.S. agriculture by allowing farms to hire foreign temporary workers. Participating employers are required to pay both foreign and domestic workers performing comparable tasks a minimum hourly wage known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate. This paper examines how increases in visa wages affect farms’ allocation of agricultural inputs. Using data from the USDA Census of Agriculture from 2002 to 2022, I implement a border-county pair design that compares counties across state lines. I find that a 1% increase in the visa wage leads to a 3.9% increase in the intensive margin of intermediate input use and a 1.1% increase on the extensive use. Higher visa wages also increase the value of machinery by 1.2%, consistent with labor-costinduced mechanization. The resulting input substitution contributes to higher agricultural productivity.'
