excerpt: 'Hiring discrimination remains widespread in labor markets, raising questions about what workers can do to improve their chances of being considered for jobs in such settings. This paper examines whether soft skills are valued by employers and whether they can help mitigate discrimination. Using a correspondence study in Malaysia, we test the effects of signaling two soft skills: leadership and teamwork. We find that Malay and Indian sounding names are 11 and 14 percentage points less likely to be contacted, compared to Chinese sounding names. Soft skills are not explicitly demanded by employers, but signaling teamwork skills significantly reduces the discrimination gap in 43% and 33% for Malay and Indian candidates. We present a model that uses the soft skill signal to disentangle if the nature of discrimination is statistical or taste-based. Our results are consistent with statistical discrimination and highlight the potential of soft skills as a strategic signal to counteract hiring discrimination.'
