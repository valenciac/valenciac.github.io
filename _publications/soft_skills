excerpt: '<p style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:600;">with Sarah Janzen, Yashodhan Ghorpade and Amanina Abdur Rahman </p> Hiring discrimination remains widespread, raising questions about how disadvantaged workers can improve labor market outcomes. We examine if employers value soft skills and whether such skills mitigate discrimination. Using a correspondence study in Malaysia, we test the effects of two soft skill signals: leadership and teamwork. We find Malay and Indian names are 11-14 percentage points less likely to be contacted, compared to Chinese names. Signaling teamwork skills reduces discrimination by 34-43%. We present a model that uses signals to distinguish statistical from taste-based discrimination. Our results are consistent with statistical discrimination, and suggest soft skills can counteract hiring discrimination. ![Figure 2](/images/Plot_website.png){: width="600px" }'
