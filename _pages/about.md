I am an Applied Economics PhD candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests are labor economics and migration policy. 

In my dissertation I study the following research questions: 1) How do farmers respond to increasing labor costs to hire migrant workers? 2) Can soft skills mitigate hiring discrimination? 3) Are demographic characteristics relevant for promotion and retention in academia?

I am on the 2025-2026 Job Market.
