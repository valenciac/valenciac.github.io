I am an Applied Economics PhD candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research combines theoretical and empirical approaches to study topics in labor economics and migration policy. 

In my dissertation I study the following research questions: 
1) How do farmers respond to increasing labor costs to hire migrant workers?
2) Can soft skills mitigate hiring discrimination?
3) Are promotion decisions associated to demographic characteristics in the academic context?  

I am on the 2025-2026 Job Market.
