I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on labor economics and migration policy. 

In my Job Market Paper I study visa regulations that increase the cost to hire foreign temporary workers in US agriculture and how they affect the domestic labor market and farm choice of inputs.

I am on the 2025-2026 Job Market.
