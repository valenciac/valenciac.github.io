I am an applied microeconomist with interests in labor economics. My research combines theoretical and empirical approaches to study how hiring decisions are made in a context of discrimination, to study if firms decide to use machinery more intensively or extensively as a response to increasing labor costs in the United States and to study how promotion decisions are made in the academic context. 

I will be in the 2025-2026 job market.
